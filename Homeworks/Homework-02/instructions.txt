 
Group Assignment: Word Count - Hadoop Streaming﻿
Due date: 6/12 by noon (12:00 PM)
Total points: 25 pts
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Instructions:

﻿1. In class we wrote a MapReduce program in Java to compute the word counts for any given input. In this assignment you will repeat solving the same problem but using Hadoop streaming in Python.
2. Create two scripts in Python namely "wordcount_map.py" and "wordcount_reduce.py" to be used by the mappers and reducers of the streaming job.
3. Your script files must be executable (consider the chmod command), and must include the necessary shebang (like in the attached script files).
4. Attached are the script files we used in class to demonstrate Hadoop streaming using ncdc data, namely: "maxtemp_map.py" and "maxtemp_reduce.py". They should be useful for getting started.
5. Please submit only the two python script files, mentioned above in (2).
6. Only one member from each group can make a submission. Please coordinate with each other before you attempt any submission on BB.
7. You have two attempts to submit the two files. Please attach both files before you click on the "submit" button. 
8. You can test your streaming application against the 3 plain text files that come with Apache Hadoop distribution, namely: (LICENSE|NOTICE|README).txt
9. Note: recall the streaming command:
$ mapred streaming \
    -files <executable_map>,<executable_reduce> \
    -mapper <executable_map> \
    -reducer <executable_reduce> \
    -input <input-path> \
    -output <output-path>
(extra options: -combiner, -numReduceTasks, etc.)
