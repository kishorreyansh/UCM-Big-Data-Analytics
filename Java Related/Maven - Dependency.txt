Add the Maven Hadoop dependency below to your MapReduce project in order for your IDE and its tools to recognize Hadoop classes.

<dependency>
<groupId>org.apache.hadoop</groupId>
<artifactId>hadoop-mapreduce-client-app</artifactId>
<version>3.2.0</version>
</dependency>

Please check your IDE documentation on how to add a dependency to your project. You can add it manually by editing the "pom.xml" file.
In class, we showed how to create a MapReduce program using only basic commands like: nano, javac, and jar. The necessary dependencies are passed to the java compiler using the classpath option.

You might also want to change the Java version in the pom.xml file (or in the project properties) to Java 8.
